    <p>  The Millman Medical Index, the average healthcare costs for a family of four is now over $25,000. 
        For those falling on hard times with hospital stays, cancer treatments with expensive chemotherapy regimens,
         the burden can be even higher. Itâ€™s hard enough to deal with the difficulties that come with illness, 
         injury or cancer treatment, without considering the additional burden of medical bills and healthcare costs. 
         The Kaiser Family Foundation estimates that at the end of 2015, over 28 millions Americans were uninsured. 
         If you don't have health insurance, even a small health issue can make it impossible to continue covering your 
         regular monthly expenses.
